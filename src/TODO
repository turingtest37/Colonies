(DONE!) Add Layout structure that supports
	tiled mode
	stacked mode for animated GIF 

Add support for pixel scale => e.g. use 4 pixels to represent 1 cell => allows for larger images w/o the long processing time [?? not sure this is a great idea, given that ImageMagick exists...]

Add ability to tweak existing patterns incrementally. Set Mask. Set StateFilter.

generatemany options for max # of filters and masks to try before changing
	choice of evaluation order (mask first or filter first) should be done at runtime - use Metaprogramming!!!!
	
(DONE! Element-wise wins!) Try formula with matrix multiplication instead of element-wise

Convert colony4j.csv into a real database. Maybe SQLLite???? Look into this!

Add support for user-supplied "reduce" functions that get the neighborhood (always centered on the current point), mask and filter as arguments

Explore colony4j-3cee5668-4df5-11ea-2512-eb2a7a6f19c4.png which has repeated on a 23-step cycle when given a random seed. What is the mechanism behind this?
