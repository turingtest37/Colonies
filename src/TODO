Add Layout structure that supports
	tiled mode
	stacked mode for animated GIF (DONE!)

Add support for pixel scale => e.g. use 4 pixels to represent 1 cell => allows for larger images w/o the long processing time [?? not sure this is a great idea, given that ImageMagick exists...]

Add ability to tweak existing patterns incrementally. Set Mask. Set StateFilter.

generatemany options for max # of filters and masks to try before changing
	choice of evaluation order (mask first or filter first) should be done at runtime - use Metaprogramming!!!!
	
Try formula with matrix multiplication instead of element-wise
